In this task 1 I have created a Simple Responsive Landing page where the website was a Furniture Store with a logo. Following which
there is the navigation bar which are clickable links that take you to other pages(Home, About, Search, Discounts). Next there is
welcoming message and button link for you to get started and explore the website. The footer consists of copyright and social media
links with logos also

Overall, I included the following features to build a Web Page layout:
> Header (logo_nav links) Section
> Hero Section with heading, paragraph and call to action
> FlexBox for layout
> HTML and CSS
> Media Query for responsive effects
> Footer with social links
